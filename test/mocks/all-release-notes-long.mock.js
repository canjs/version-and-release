     '[can-set v1.4.0 - Algebra.has() does not check sorting nor pagination](https://github.com/canjs/can-set/releases/tag/v1.4.0)\nPreviously `can-set.Algebra.has()` operated somewhat similarly to `can-set.Algebra.subset()` in that it had a special treatment for when a set had sorting and pagination together, to ensure that sorting/order was checked first.  This didn\'t make sense in the case of `has()` since it checks instance properties instead of sets, and instances in general do not know their own positions in sorted queries nor do they contain sort information of their own.\r\n\r\nThis has been released as a minor revision instead of a patch: even though no changes in the can-set tests nor documentation were necessary, we cannot guarantee that it won\'t break users\' code relying on `Algebra.has()`.',
     '[can-set v1.5.0 - Fix issues with Algebra.prototype.difference()](https://github.com/canjs/can-set/releases/tag/v1.5.0)\nThis release includes PR #82, which improved the difference() function for set.Algebra -- some differences involving paging were incorrect, now fixed, and differences involving ID fields are now supported as well.  Also, `undefined` is no longer returned; the function now agrees with its documentation and returns `false` when A - B = A or  A - B = ∅ (for sets A and B).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the documentation for union() in set.Algebra was updated to reflect the actual return value: `false` if the union cannot be expressed as a Set.',
     '[can-set v1.5.1 - Remove duplicate items in Algebra.prototype.getUnion()](https://github.com/canjs/can-set/releases/tag/v1.5.1)\nGiven an algebra:\r\n`set.props.id("id")`\r\n\r\nand these two sets:\r\n`{ type: \'a\' }`\r\n`{ area: \'x\' }`\r\n\r\nAnd these two lists related to the respective sets:\r\n`[{ id: 1, type: \'a\' area: \'x\' }, { id: 2, type: \'a\', area: \'y\' }]`\r\n`[{ id: 1, type: \'a\' area: \'x\' }, { id: 3, type: \'b\', area: \'x\' }]`\r\n\r\nPreviously, the result of `getUnion()` would return a simple concatenation of these two lists:\r\n`[{ id: 1, type: \'a\' area: \'x\' }, { id: 2, type: \'a\', area: \'y\' }, { id: 1, type: \'a\' area: \'x\' }, { id: 3, type: \'b\', area: \'x\' }]`\r\n\r\nThis is suboptimal in cases like in can-connect\'s cache-requests behavior, where the union of several sets may be used to build a query response for yet a different set.  Each item should be represented at most once when creating the union.  With this release, items in both `aItems` and `bItems` are removed from the `bItems` before concatenating into a union result.  The example above becomes:\r\n\r\n`[{ id: 1, type: \'a\' area: \'x\' }, { id: 2, type: \'a\', area: \'y\' }, { id: 3, type: \'b\', area: \'x\' }]`\r\n\r\n> Note: this doesn\'t remove all duplicates, just removes duplicates from `bItems` that are already in `aItems` -- if `aItems` already has a duplicate, or `bItems` has a duplicate not in `aItems`, it will be preserved.\r\n ',
